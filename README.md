**Project Description:** 

Project Description:
The Employee Records Cleansing project was undertaken to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the employee data stored in the SQL Server database. The primary goal was to identify and rectify any issues within the employee records, including duplicates, missing values, and incorrect data entries. This project involved several key steps:

*Data Profiling:*

- Conducted an initial assessment of the employee records to identify common data quality issues.
- Analyzed the distribution, range, and patterns within the data to understand the extent of the cleansing required.

*Data Standardization:*

- Standardized data formats for fields such as phone numbers, addresses, and names to maintain consistency.
- Converted data into appropriate formats where necessary (e.g., date formats, case sensitivity).

*Data Validation and Correction:*

- Implemented validation checks to identify and correct erroneous data entries.
- Used SQL functions and conditional logic to handle null values and incorrect data formats.

*String Manipulation and Functions:*

- Used wildcards and the *LIKE* operator to identify records matching specific patterns.
- Employed the *CONCAT* function to combine string fields for standardized reporting and data integration.
- Utilized *SUBSTRING* to extract specific parts of text fields for accurate data representation.

*Data Type Conversion:*

- Applied the *CAST* function to convert data types, ensuring consistency and accuracy in data processing.

*Date and Time Functions:*

- Utilized the *GETDATE* function to retrieve current date and time for time-based data operations and validation.

*Data Integrity:*

- Ensured referential integrity by verifying relationships between tables.
- Updated or deleted records that violated integrity constraints to maintain data consistency.

*Documentation and Reporting:*

- Documented the data cleansing process, including the steps taken and the SQL scripts used.
- Generated reports to summarize the improvements in data quality and the outcomes of the cleansing process.

This project significantly enhanced the quality of the employee data, ensuring that it is accurate, reliable, and ready for use in reporting and decision-making processes. The clean data now supports better HR management, payroll processing, and compliance reporting.
